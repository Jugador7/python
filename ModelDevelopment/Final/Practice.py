Objectives
In this project, you will:

Load the data as a pandas dataframe
Clean the data, taking care of the blank entries
Run exploratory data analysis (EDA) and identify the attributes that most affect the charges
Develop single variable and multi variable Linear Regression models for predicting the charges
Use Ridge regression to refine the performance of Linear regression models.
Setup
For this lab, we will be using the following libraries:

skillsnetwork to download the data
pandas for managing the data.
numpy for mathematical operations.
sklearn for machine learning and machine-learning-pipeline related functions.
seaborn for visualizing the data.
matplotlib for additional plotting tools.
The following required libraries are not pre-installed in the Skills Network Labs environment. You will need to run the following cell to install them:

import piplite
await piplite.install('seaborn')
Importing Required Libraries
We recommend you import all required libraries in one place (here):

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, Ridge
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, train_test_split

Download the dataset to this lab environment
Run the cell below to load the dataset to this lab environment.

from pyodide.http import pyfetch

async def download(url, filename):
    response = await pyfetch(url)
    if response.status == 200:
        with open(filename, "wb") as f:
            f.write(await response.bytes())
filepath = 'https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DA0101EN-Coursera/medical_insurance_dataset.csv'
await download(filepath, "insurance.csv")
file_name="insurance.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(file_name)
Note: This version of the lab is working on JupyterLite, which requires the dataset to be downloaded to the interface.While working on the downloaded version of this notebook on their local machines(Jupyter Anaconda), the learners can simply skip the steps above, and simply use the URL directly in the pandas.read_csv() function. You can uncomment and run the statements in the cell below.

#filepath = 'https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DA0101EN-Coursera/medical_insurance_dataset.csv'
#df = pd.read_csv(filepath, header=None)
  
Task 1 : Import the datasetÂ¶

Import the dataset into a pandas dataframe. Note that there are currently no headers in the CSV file.

Print the first 10 rows of the dataframe to confirm successful loading.

print(df.head(10))
   19  1    27.9  0 1.1  3    16884.924
0  18  2  33.770  1   0  4   1725.55230

9  25  2  26.220  0   0  2   2721.32080

Add the headers to the dataframe, as mentioned in the project scenario.

headers = ["age", "gender", "bmi", "no_of_children", "smoker", "region", "charges"]
df.columns = headers

Now, replace the '? entries with 'NaN' values.

df.replace('?', np.nan, inplace = True)

Task 2 : Data Wrangling
Use dataframe.info() to identify the columns that have some 'Null' (or NaN) information.

print(df.info())
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
RangeIndex: 2771 entries, 0 to 2770
Data columns (total 7 columns):
 #   Column          Non-Null Count  Dtype  
---  ------          --------------  -----  
 0   age             2767 non-null   object 
 1   gender          2771 non-null   int64  
 2   bmi             2771 non-null   float64
 3   no_of_children  2771 non-null   int64  
 4   smoker          2764 non-null   object 
 5   region          2771 non-null   int64  
 6   charges         2771 non-null   float64
dtypes: float64(2), int64(3), object(2)

print(df.info())
Handle missing data:

For continuous attributes (e.g., age), replace missing values with the mean.
For categorical attributes (e.g., smoker), replace missing values with the most frequent value.
Update the data types of the respective columns.
Verify the update using df.info().

# smoker is a categorical attribute, replace with most frequent entry
is_smoker = df['smoker'].value_counts().idxmax()
df["smoker"].replace(np.nan, is_smoker, inplace=True)

# age is a continuous variable, replace with mean age
mean_age = df['age'].astype('float').mean(axis=0)
df["age"].replace(np.nan, mean_age, inplace=True)

# Update data types
df[["age","smoker"]] = df[["age","smoker"]].astype("int")

print(df.info())

# smoker is a categorical attribute, replace with most frequent entry
is_smoker = df['smoker'].value_counts().idxmax()
df["smoker"].replace(np.nan, is_smoker, inplace=True)

# age is a continuous variable, replace with mean age
mean_age = df['age'].astype('float').mean(axis=0)
df["age"].replace(np.nan, mean_age, inplace=True)

# Update data types
df[["age","smoker"]] = df[["age","smoker"]].astype("int")

print(df.info())
Also note, that the charges column has values which are more than 2 decimal places long. Update the charges column such that all values are rounded to nearest 2 decimal places. Verify conversion by printing the first 5 values of the updated dataframe.

df[["charges"]] = np.round(df[["charges"]],2)
print(df.head())

df[["charges"]] = np.round(df[["charges"]],2)
