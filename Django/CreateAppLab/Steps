pip install --upgrade distro-info
pip3 install --upgrade pip==23.2.1
pip install virtualenv

5. Create django app within the project 

python3 manage.py startapp firstapp

manage.py is a command-line interface used to interact with the Django project to perform tasks such as starting the server,
migrating models, and so on.
firstproject/settings.py contains the settings and configurations information.
firstproject/urls.py contains the URL and route definitions of your Django apps within the project.

firstapp/admin.py: is for building an admin site
firstapp/models.py: contains model classes
firstapp/views.py: contains view functions/classes
firstapp/urls.py: contains URL declarations and routing for the app

9. Find INSTALLED_APPS section, and add a new app entry as

'firstapp.apps.FirstappConfig',

10. Create an empty urls.py under firstapp folder

cd firstapp # Make sure you are in firstapp directory
touch urls.py

11. Also import the flowing in that urls.py

from django.urls import include, path

12. Add new paths

path('firstapp/', include('firstapp.urls')),
path('', include('firstapp.urls')),  # Add this line to match the empty path

pipreqs .

3. Create docker file 

> Dockerfile

4. Put this in dockerfile

# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM python:3
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
WORKDIR /code
COPY requirements.txt /code/
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . /code/
CMD ["python", "manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8000"]

5. Command to create docker image
