Scenario
In this assignment you will be tasked with creating plots which answer questions for analysing "historical_automobile_sales" data to understand the historical trends in automobile sales during recession periods.
recession period 1 - year 1980
recession period 2 - year 1981 to 1982
recession period 3 - year 1991
recession period 4 - year 2000 to 2001
recession period 5 - year end 2007 to mid 2009
recession period 6 - year 2020 -Feb to April (Covid-19 Impact)

Data Description
The dataset used for this visualization assignment contains historical_automobile_sales data representing automobile sales and related variables during recession and non-recession period.

The dataset includes the following variables:
1. Date: The date of the observation.
2. Recession: A binary variable indicating recession perion; 1 means it was recession, 0 means it was normal.
3. Automobile_Sales: The number of vehicles sold during the period.
4. GDP: The per capita GDP value in USD.
5. Unemployment_Rate: The monthly unemployment rate.
6. Consumer_Confidence: A synthetic index representing consumer confidence, which can impact consumer spending and automobile purchases.
7. Seasonality_Weight: The weight representing the seasonality effect on automobile sales during the period.
8. Price: The average vehicle price during the period.
9. Advertising_Expenditure: The advertising expenditure of the company.
10.Vehicle_Type: The type of vehicles sold; Supperminicar, Smallfamiliycar, Mediumfamilycar, Executivecar, Sports.
11.Competition: The measure of competition in the market, such as the number of competitors or market share of major manufacturers.
12.Month: Month of the observation extracted from Date..
13.Year: Year of the observation extracted from Date.
By examining various factors mentioned above from the dataset, you aim to gain insights into how recessions impacted automobile sales for your company.

Creating Visualizations for Data Analysis
TASK 1.1: Develop a Line chart using the functionality of pandas to show how automobile sales fluctuate from year to year

 #create data for plotting
    df_line = df.groupby(df['Year'])['Automobile_Sales'].mean()
    #create figure
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    df_line.plot(kind = 'line')
    plt.xlabel('year')
    plt.ylabel('Automobile Sales')
    plt.title('Automobile Sales Fluctuation per Year')
    plt.show()

Include the following on the plotÂ¶
ticks on x- axis with all the years, to identify the years of recession
annotation for at least two years of recession
Title as Automobile Sales during Recession

 plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    df_line = df.groupby(df['Year'])['Automobile_Sales'].mean()
    df_line.plot(kind = 'line')
    plt.xticks(list(range(1980,2024)), rotation = 75)
    plt.xlabel('year')
    plt.ylabel('Automobile Sales')
    plt.title('Automobile Sales during Recession')
    plt.text(1982, 650, '1981-82 Recession')
    plt.text(1991, 650, '1991 Recession')
    plt.text(2020, 2000, '2020 Recession')
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

TASK 1.2: Plot different lines for categories of vehicle type and analyse the trend to answer the question Is there a noticeable difference in sales trends between different vehicle types during recession periods?

   df_rec = df[df['Recession']==1]
    df_Mline = df_rec.groupby(['Year','Vehicle_Type'], as_index=False)['Automobile_Sales'].mean()
    df_Mline.set_index('Year', inplace=True)
    df_Mline = df_Mline.groupby(['Vehicle_Type'])['Automobile_Sales']
    df_Mline.plot(kind='line')
    plt.xlabel('Years')
    plt.ylabel('Automobile Sales')
    plt.title('Sales Trend Vehicle-wise during Recession')
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

TASK 1.3: Use the functionality of Seaborn Library to create a visualization to compare the sales trend per vehicle type for a recession period with a non-recession period.

    new_df = df.groupby('Recession')['Automobile_Sales'].mean().reset_index()

    # Create the bar chart using seaborn
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.barplot(x='Recession', y='Automobile_Sales', hue='Recession',  data=new_df)
    plt.xlabel('Recession period vs. Non-recession period')
    plt.ylabel('Average Sales')
    plt.title('Average Automobile Sales during Recession and Non-Recession')
    plt.xticks(ticks=[0, 1], labels=['Non-Recession', 'Recession'])
    plt.show()
Now you want to compare the sales of different vehicle types during a recession and a non-recession period


 # Filter the data for recessionary periods
    recession_data = df[df['Recession'] == 1]

    dd=df.groupby(['Recession','Vehicle_Type'])['Automobile_Sales'].mean().reset_index()

    # Calculate the total sales volume by vehicle type during recessions
    #sales_by_vehicle_type = recession_data.groupby('Vehicle_Type')['Automobile_Sales'].sum().reset_index()

    # Create the grouped bar chart using seaborn
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.barplot(x='Recession', y='Automobile_Sales', hue='Vehicle_Type', data=dd)
    plt.xticks(ticks=[0, 1], labels=['Non-Recession', 'Recession'])
    plt.xlabel('Recession vs. Non-recession')
    plt.ylabel('Automobile Sales')
    plt.title('Vehicle-Wise Sales during Recession and Non-Recession Period')

    plt.show()

TASK 1.4: Use sub plotting to compare the variations in GDP during recession and non-recession period by developing line plots for each period.
Now, you want to find more insights from the data to understand the reason.
Plot a two line charts using subplotting to answer:-

How did the GDP vary over time during recession and non-recession periods?

Make use of add_subplot() from Matplotlib for this comparision.

   #Create dataframes for recession and non-recession period
    rec_data = df[df['Recession'] == 1]
    non_rec_data = df[df['Recession'] == 0]
    
    #Figure
    fig=plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
    
    #Create different axes for subploting
    ax0 = fig.add_subplot(1, 2, 1) # add subplot 1 (1 row, 2 columns, first plot)
    ax1 = fig.add_subplot(1, 2, 2) # add subplot 2 (1 row, 2 columns, second plot). 
    
    #plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
    sns.lineplot(x='Year', y='GDP', data=rec_data, label='Recession', ax=ax0)
    ax0.set_xlabel('Year')
    ax0.set_ylabel('GDP')
    ax0.set_title('GDP Variation during Recession Period')
    
    #plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
    sns.lineplot(x='Year', y='GDP', data=non_rec_data, label='Non-recession',ax=ax1)
    ax1.set_xlabel('Year')
    ax1.set_ylabel('GDP')
    ax1.set_title('GDP Variation during Non-recession Period')
    
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

TASK 1.5: Develop a Bubble plot for displaying the impact of seasonality on Automobile Sales.

How has seasonality impacted the sales, in which months the sales were high or low? Check it for non-recession years to understand the trend

Develop a Bubble plot for displaying Automobile Sales for every month and use Seasonality Weight for representing the size of each bubble
Title this plot as 'Seasonality impact on Automobile Sales'

non_rec_data = df[df['Recession'] == 0]
    
    size=non_rec_data['Seasonality_Weight'] #for bubble effect
    
    sns.scatterplot(data=non_rec_data, x='Month', y='Automobile_Sales', size=size)
    
    #you can further include hue='Seasonality_Weight', legend=False)

    plt.xlabel('Month')
    plt.ylabel('Automobile_Sales')
    plt.title('Seasonality impact on Automobile Sales')

    plt.show()

TASK 1.6: Use the functionality of Matplotlib to develop a scatter plot to identify the correlation between average vehicle price relate to the sales volume during recessions.
From the data, develop a scatter plot to identify if there a correlation between consumer confidence and automobile sales during recession period?

Title this plot as 'Consumer Confidence and Automobile Sales during Recessions'

#Create dataframes for recession and non-recession period
    rec_data = df[df['Recession'] == 1]
    plt.scatter(rec_data['Consumer_Confidence'], rec_data['Automobile_Sales'])
    
    plt.xlabel('Consumer Confidence')
    plt.ylabel('Automobile_Sales')
    plt.title('Correlation between consumer confidence and Automobile Sales during Recession Period')
    plt.show()

How does the average vehicle price relate to the sales volume during recessions?

Plot another scatter plot and title it as 'Relationship between Average Vehicle Price and Sales during Recessions'

 #Create dataframes for recession and non-recession period
    rec_data = df[df['Recession'] == 1]
    plt.scatter(recession_data['Price'], rec_data['Automobile_Sales'])
    
    plt.xlabel('Price')
    plt.ylabel('Automobile_Sales')
    plt.title('Automobile Sales and Price relation during recessions')
    plt.show()

TASK 1.7: Create a pie chart to display the portion of advertising expenditure of XYZAutomotives during recession and non-recession periods.

How did the advertising expenditure of XYZAutomotives change during recession and non-recession periods?

      # Filter the data 
    Rdata = df[df['Recession'] == 1]
    NRdata = df[df['Recession'] == 0]

    # Calculate the total advertising expenditure for both periods
    RAtotal = Rdata['Advertising_Expenditure'].sum()
    NRAtotal = NRdata['Advertising_Expenditure'].sum()

    # Create a pie chart for the advertising expenditure 
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))

    labels = ['Recession', 'Non-Recession']
    sizes = [RAtotal, NRAtotal]
    plt.pie(sizes, labels=labels, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=90)

    plt.title('Avertising expenditure of XYZAutomotives during recession and non-recession periods.')

    plt.show()

TASK 1.8: Develop a pie chart to display the total Advertisement expenditure for each vehicle type during recession period.
Can we observe the share of each vehicle type in total expenditure during recessions?

  # Filter the data 
    Rdata = df[df['Recession'] == 1]

    # Calculate the sales volume by vehicle type during recessions
    VTexpenditure = Rdata.groupby('Vehicle_Type')['Automobile_Sales'].sum()

    # Create a pie chart for the share of each vehicle type in total expenditure during recessions
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

    labels = VTexpenditure.index
    sizes = VTexpenditure.values
    plt.pie(sizes, labels=labels, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=90)

    plt.title('Advertisement expenditure for each vehicle type during recession period.')

    plt.show()

TASK 1.9: Develop a lineplot to analyse the effect of the unemployment rate on vehicle type and sales during the Recession Period.

Analyze the effect of the unemployment rate on vehicle type and sales during the Recession Period

You can create a lineplot and title the plot as 'Effect of Unemployment Rate on Vehicle Type and Sales'

df_rec = df[df['Recession']==1]
markers = ['o', 's', 'D', '^', 'v']  # Puedes agregar mÃ¡s si hay mÃ¡s tipos
sns.lineplot(data=df_rec, x='unemployment_rate', y='Automobile_Sales',
             hue='Vehicle_Type', style='Vehicle_Type', markers=markers, err_style=None)
plt.ylim(0,850)
plt.legend(loc=(0.05,.3))
plt.title('Effect of Unemployment Rate on Vehicle Type and Sales')
